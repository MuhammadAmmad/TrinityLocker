#Trinity Locker
----------
An upcoming lock-screen app that allows for various customizations, utilizes the modern Material design, and is light on resources.


**KEY FEATURES**
----------
 -  Ability to detect if the home button is being pressed (which makes the phone access to the launcher, we don't want that) and quickly intercept the action and return back to the locker
 - App widgets and custom widgets like images, text, sprites, etc
 - LED/Vibration/Notification settings for apps
 - Change speed of animations (Like Nova Launcher does), also be able to choose different types of animations for the lock-screen
 - Customize theme of the app (Dark Material and Light Material)
 - Different lock 'profiles' that show whenever the conditions configured are met, similar to C Locker (like Bluetooth connections, music playing, WiFi, SmartLock conditions ,etc)
 - Allows the user to use one of the several different unlock styles, like Fingerprint (Thanks to Android 6.0.1), Pattern, Pin, SmartLock, Slide-To-Unlock, and Gestures
 - Ability to be used in Tasker to create tasks that can, for example, check for launched apps**
 - Integrated voice assistants like Google Now/Google Assistant, S Voice, and such others
 - Ability to do functions like override the system settings and bypass system lock via root**
** = Features that may be removed before final release
